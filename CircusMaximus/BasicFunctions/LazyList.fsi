/// LazyLists are possibly-infinite, cached sequences. See also IEnumerable/Seq for
/// uncached sequences. LazyLists normally involve delayed computations without
/// side-effects. The results of these computations are cached and evaluations will be
/// performed only once for each element of the lazy list. In contrast, for sequences
/// (IEnumerable) recomputation happens each time an enumerator is created and the sequence
/// traversed.
///
/// LazyLists can represent cached, potentially-infinite computations. Because they are
/// cached they may cause memory leaks if some active code or data structure maintains a
/// live reference to the head of an infinite or very large lazy list while iterating it,
/// or if a reference is maintained after the list is no longer required.
///
/// Lazy lists may be matched using the LazyList.Cons and LazyList.Nil active patterns.
/// These may force the computation of elements of the list.

#Circus Maximus: The Game

A simple chariot racing game for a Latin class project (which was due November 7, 2013), written in F# using MonoGame.

##Building
The MonoGame assembly referenced is the Mac version, so if you're using OSX you should only have to build and run the solution in Xamarin Studio! Otherwise, simply replace the assemblies in lib/ with the appropriate versions for your platform.
